    <h2 class="part1">Identifying Usability Problems</h2>
    <p>In this assignment, students were tasked with identifying a website with Usability issues, visually redesigning the website,
        and finally building the redesign using HTML and CSS. To start, I chose <a href="www.irishwrecksonline.net">irishwrecksonline.net</a>
        a website that provides information on dive-able shipwrecks around Ireland.
        The website has a lot of usability issues, including a lack of alt text, poor color contrast, and a lack of mobile responsiveness.
        The design also dated and there are a lot of creative ways that this information can be presented. Second, the website's design is simple but unintuitive so I believe I can significantly improve the user experience.
        Finally, I am interested in shipwrecks and diving and enjoy the content of the website. The website is pictured below.
