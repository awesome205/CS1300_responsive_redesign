# Assignment for Brown University CS 1300 Class

This assignment was to pick a website of choice and redesign it. I selected [Irishshipwrecks](https://web.archive.org/web/20240312032050/http://irishwrecksonline.net/) website as I enjoy the topic of shipwrecks and the website design seems quite outdated.

Using the final high-fidelity prototypes, create the page using HTML and CSS! Buttons or navigational elements can be replaced with dummy elements. If there are dropdown menus or other more dynamic elements, you can try to recreate them at least visually, but they do not need to actually be interactive.
